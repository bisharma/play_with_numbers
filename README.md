# play_with_numbers
Checking the reusability  of the modules. 

I've used the source code from the link https://github.com/Altiss/SENG560-Prog-Assign-1
This was available in the Javascript.

How-to-use.
Steps to execute: 
1. Download the folder structure same as in this github. 

       Calc_app
             >>lib folder
                     >> lib file from the https://github.com/Altiss/SENG560-Prog-Assign-1
            >> play_with_numbers.html

2. run the play_with_numbers.html.html file. 
3. Choose the operation you want to perform from the top of the menu.
4. Input the two numbers you want to do the operation with. Choose the basenumber to select Binay, Decimal, Octa or Hexa.
5. For SQRT it will prompt you only for one number.
6. Click Calculate or Press Enter. 

Notes: The source code was well written. I think the source code was robust enough to have all the expected functionalities. The source code could be called by just passing the variable and the parameter.

I should say software reuse was much more like a "Blac Box Reuse", as no code modificaiton or adjustment was necessary to call the modules.
